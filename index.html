            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                paws are
                white and they look like mittens.
                Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                injured.
                Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                crazy
                and meows to go out.</p>

            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                a bee
                stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                four
                days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>
